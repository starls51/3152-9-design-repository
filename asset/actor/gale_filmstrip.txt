Comments:	We may be able to use these to parse animations;

These animations were imported using tiled to arrange and separate the filmstrips into a grid; filmstrips are handled by Tiled in the same manner as tilesets, but in this case Tiled calls the frames tiles (as can be seen in the JSON). The sub category animation defines the duration (in milliseconds) of each individual frame, and the tileID of each frame starting from the top left tile.
